  - question: "What is the Wall of Awful in ADHD?"
    answer: "The Wall of Awful is a concept coined by ADHD coach Brendan Mahan. It describes the invisible emotional barrier built from past failures, rejections, and negative experiences associated with a task. Before you can even start working, you have to climb over all those accumulated bad feelings, which is why starting feels so impossibly hard."
  - question: "Why can't I start working even when I want to (ADHD)?"
    answer: "This is called ADHD paralysis or executive dysfunction. Your brain's prefrontal cortex, which handles task initiation, works differently with ADHD. You're not lazy. Your brain literally struggles to activate the 'start' command, especially for tasks that don't provide immediate dopamine rewards. External triggers and zero-friction systems bypass this bottleneck."
  - question: "Does having too many productivity apps make ADHD worse?"
    answer: "Yes. Each app represents a decision point, and ADHD brains are particularly vulnerable to decision fatigue. Multiple tools also mean multiple places to check, multiple systems to maintain, and multiple opportunities to feel like you're failing. Simplifying to one zero-friction tool often works better than optimizing many tools."
  - question: "How do I overcome task paralysis with ADHD?"
    answer: "Remove friction, not add willpower. Instead of more planning or more tools, use a system that requires zero decisions to start. The goal is to eliminate the gap between 'I want to work' and 'I'm working'. One task, one timer, one click. The simpler the system, the less your executive dysfunction can sabotage you."

You know that feeling.

You have work to do. Important work. You actually *want* to do it.

You open your laptop. You look at your to-do list. You look at Notion. You check Trello. You wonder if maybe you should move everything to Todoist. Or maybe Asana would help you finally get organized.

Three hours later, you've reorganized your entire productivity system, created a new color-coding scheme, and watched two YouTube videos about the "ultimate ADHD workflow."

You haven't done any actual work.

**This isn't procrastination. It's paralysis.** And there's a name for what's causing it.

## The Wall of Awful: Why Starting Feels Impossible

ADHD coach Brendan Mahan coined a term that perfectly captures what you're experiencing: **The Wall of Awful**.

Here's the concept: every time you've tried to start a task and failed, every time you've been criticized for not finishing something, every time you've felt shame about your productivity, a brick gets added to an invisible wall.

Before you can start any task, you first have to climb over all those accumulated feelings.

That wall isn't made of laziness. It's made of:
- Past failures you still remember
- The shame of unfinished projects
- Fear of not doing it "right"
- The overwhelm of not knowing where to start
- Every time someone said "why can't you just do it?"

**No wonder you freeze.** You're not avoiding the task. You're avoiding the entire emotional minefield surrounding the task.

## The Productivity Tool Trap (Making the Wall Higher)

Here's what makes it worse: the productivity industry has convinced us that the solution to not getting things done is more tools.

Can't focus? Try this focus app.
Can't remember tasks? Try this task manager.
Can't organize projects? Try this project management tool.

So now you have:
- Notion for "big picture planning"
- Trello for "project boards"
- Todoist for "quick tasks"
- Google Calendar for "time blocking"
- A physical planner "for things that really matter"
- Three different note apps you switch between

**Each tool is a decision.** Where does this task go? Which system should I use? Did I check all my inboxes?

For a neurotypical brain, this is manageable. Annoying, but manageable.

For an ADHD brain, **each decision is a tax on your limited executive function.** And you're paying that tax before you've done any actual work.

The fancy productivity system isn't helping you climb the Wall of Awful. It's adding more bricks.

## The Real Problem: Friction Before the First Step

Let me show you what happens when you try to start work with a complex system:

1. You decide to work
2. You open your laptop
3. You wonder which tool to open first
4. You open Notion to check your priorities
5. You realize you haven't updated your weekly review
6. You feel guilty about the weekly review
7. You decide to "quickly" update it
8. Twenty minutes into that, you remember you need to check Trello
9. Trello reminds you of three overdue tasks
10. The guilt compounds
11. You decide you need a better system
12. You start researching productivity tools
13. Two hours gone. Wall of Awful: taller than ever.

**The friction isn't in the work. The friction is in getting to the work.**

Every step between "I want to work" and "I'm working" is a chance for your brain to bail out.

## The Zero Friction Solution: Nothing Between You and Work

Here's what actually works for ADHD brains. It's not sexy. It's not "optimized." But it's effective.

**Remove everything between the decision and the action.**

When you want to work, you need exactly ONE thing to happen:
- One click
- One tool
- One task in front of you

Not "let me check what I should work on."
Not "let me set up my environment."
Not "let me review my system."

Just: work is in front of you. Timer starts. You work.

### The Protocol

**Step 1: Stop Adding Tools**

Your next productivity tool purchase won't fix you. Neither will the one after that. Tools can't solve a friction problem. They usually create more friction.

**Step 2: Pick ONE Task**

Not your whole to-do list. Not your prioritized backlog. Not your someday/maybe pile.

One task. The thing you're going to work on right now. Everything else is invisible until this is done.

**Step 3: Eliminate Decisions**

When you sit down to work, there should be zero decisions required:
- Where do I look? (One place)
- What do I work on? (Already decided)
- How long do I work? (Timer is set)
- When do I take a break? (Timer will tell you)

**Step 4: Make Starting Instant**

The gap between "I'll start working" and "I'm working" should be under 3 seconds. Any longer and your brain has time to find escape routes.

## Why Simpler Beats Smarter

Your ADHD brain doesn't need a smarter system. It needs a dumber one.

Complex systems require executive function to operate. But executive function is exactly what ADHD brains struggle with. You're asking your weak point to carry your whole productivity system.

Simple systems are idiot-proof. And when your executive function is depleted, you want idiot-proof. You want a system that a tired, distracted, overwhelmed version of you can still use.

**The test:** Can you start working when you're at your worst? When you're tired, when you're stressed, when your ADHD is flaring?

If your system only works when you're at your best, it doesn't work.

## The Tool I Built (And Why)

I'll be transparent with you.

I tried every productivity system. Notion databases with 47 properties. Trello boards with complex automations. Todoist with filters and labels and priorities.

They all made the Wall of Awful taller.

So I built [Getting Shit Done](https://gettingshitdone.pro) with one principle: **zero friction to starting work.**

- No login or account (one less barrier)
- No complex setup (open and work)
- One task visible at a time (no decision paralysis)
- Timer starts immediately (no setup required)
- Built-in focus audio (no switching to Spotify)

The entire philosophy is: the distance between "I want to work" and "I'm working" should be one click.

You don't need another tool that promises to "finally" organize your life. You need a tool that gets out of your way so you can actually work.

The Wall of Awful is real. But you can make it irrelevant by removing everything between you and the first step.

**Stop optimizing your system. Start lowering the barrier to starting.**
