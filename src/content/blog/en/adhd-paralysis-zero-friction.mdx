faq:
  - question: "What is ADHD paralysis?"
    answer: "ADHD paralysis (also called task paralysis or executive dysfunction freeze) is when your brain completely locks up despite wanting to work. It's not laziness - it's your prefrontal cortex struggling to initiate action because it perceives too many steps, decisions, or emotional barriers between you and the task. The more friction in your system, the more likely paralysis strikes."
  - question: "Why can't I start working even when I want to?"
    answer: "Your brain is doing a rapid unconscious calculation: 'How many steps before actual work begins?' If it sees login screens, password prompts, deciding what to work on, finding files, and choosing tools - each step is a friction point where your executive function can fail. ADHD brains are especially sensitive to this friction. You don't lack motivation; you have too many obstacles before the starting line."
  - question: "How do I break ADHD paralysis instantly?"
    answer: "Remove all friction between the decision to work and actually working. This means: no login required, no setup needed, no decisions about what to work on (decide beforehand), and instant action within 3 seconds. The zero-friction method works because it gives your brain no time to bail out. Click, timer starts, you're working. The trick is making 'not working' require more effort than working."
  - question: "Does zero-friction productivity work for ADHD?"
    answer: "Yes, because it addresses the root cause of ADHD paralysis: executive dysfunction at the point of task initiation. Complex systems require executive function to operate - the exact thing ADHD brains struggle with. Zero-friction systems bypass this entirely. They're 'dumb' on purpose, requiring no willpower, no decisions, and no mental overhead. When starting is effortless, paralysis has nothing to grip onto."

You're staring at your screen again.

The cursor blinks. Your to-do list sits open in another tab. You know exactly what you need to do. You even *want* to do it.

But you can't start.

Your body is frozen. Your mind is racing but going nowhere. You've been "about to start" for 47 minutes. Maybe you checked your phone. Maybe you opened a new browser tab. Maybe you just... sat there, unable to move, feeling the anxiety build while absolutely nothing happens.

**This is ADHD paralysis.** And if you're reading this, you probably know it intimately.

The worst part? It has nothing to do with laziness. Nothing to do with not caring. You care *too much*. That's partially why you're stuck.

## Why Your Brain Freezes (The Real Reason)

Let me explain what's actually happening in your brain when paralysis hits.

Your prefrontal cortex - the part responsible for executive function, planning, and initiating action - works differently with ADHD. It needs more activation to get going. Way more than neurotypical brains.

But here's what nobody tells you: **your brain is constantly running a background calculation.**

Before you start any task, your brain unconsciously asks: *"How many steps until I'm actually working?"*

And it counts *everything*:

1. Open the laptop
2. Enter password
3. Wait for it to load
4. Decide which project to work on
5. Open the project management tool
6. Log in (what was that password again?)
7. Navigate to the right board
8. Remember where you left off
9. Figure out what the next action actually is
10. Find the relevant files
11. Get distracted by 3 notifications
12. Decide if you should check those first
13. Check them (of course)
14. Try to remember what you were doing
15. Start over from step 4

**Each step is a friction point.** Each friction point is a chance for your brain to bail.

And here's the brutal truth: with ADHD, your brain is *looking* for exit routes. Not because you're weak. Because your dopamine system is dysregulated and will grab any escape from an unpleasant initiation sequence.

More steps = more exit routes = more paralysis.

## The Wall of Awful Makes It Worse

ADHD coach Brendan Mahan identified something called the **Wall of Awful** - and once you understand it, everything clicks.

Every time you've tried to start working and failed, a brick gets added to an invisible wall. Every criticism about your productivity. Every missed deadline. Every time you've disappointed yourself. Brick after brick after brick.

Before you can even *begin* a task, you have to emotionally climb over that wall.

The wall is built from:
- The shame of yesterday's unfinished work
- Fear of finding out how behind you really are
- Memories of past failures on similar tasks
- Anxiety about whether you can actually do this
- Every time someone said "why can't you just do it?"

Now combine this with a high-friction system full of logins, decisions, and setup steps.

**You're asking an exhausted climber to navigate an obstacle course before they can even reach the wall.**

No wonder you freeze.

## The Friction Problem Nobody Talks About

Here's what's happening when "simple" tasks feel impossible:

**What a neurotypical brain sees:**
"I'll work on the project" → Works on the project

**What an ADHD brain experiences:**
"I'll work on the project" → Which project? → Open laptop → Password → Notion or Trello? → Log in → Which workspace? → What was I doing? → Check the board → 14 cards that need attention → Which one first? → I should reorganize this → Opens new browser tab → Researches "best ADHD productivity system" → 2 hours gone → Shame → Bigger Wall of Awful

**The friction isn't in the work. It's in getting to the work.**

Every login screen is friction.
Every decision point is friction.
Every "where did I leave off?" is friction.
Every choice between tools is friction.

And your brain, starving for dopamine and desperately seeking the path of least resistance, will choose *anything* over that friction gauntlet.

That's not a character flaw. That's neurology.

## The Ah-Ha Moment: It's Not About Motivation

Here's what changed everything for me:

**The problem isn't motivation. It's friction.**

I spent years trying to "fix" my motivation. More apps. Better systems. Accountability partners. Habit trackers. Motivational videos. Therapy. Medication.

Some of it helped. But I still had paralysis episodes. Bad ones.

Then I realized: every "productivity improvement" I made added complexity. And complexity is friction. And friction is the enemy.

The gap between "I want to work" and "I'm working" kept getting *longer*, not shorter. More logins. More decisions. More places to check. More chances for my brain to bail.

**The solution wasn't more motivation to push through friction. It was eliminating the friction entirely.**

Think about it: what if starting work was *easier* than not starting? What if the effort required to procrastinate was actually *higher* than the effort required to work?

That's the zero-friction principle.

## The Zero-Friction Method: How to Actually Beat ADHD Paralysis

Here's the approach that finally worked:

### Principle 1: Nothing Between Decision and Action

When you decide to work, you should be working within 3 seconds. Maximum.

Not "open the app." Not "log in." Not "find your project." Not "remember where you left off."

**Decision → Working. Three seconds.**

Any gap longer than that gives your brain time to find escape routes. And it *will* find them.

### Principle 2: Zero Decisions at Start Time

Decisions require executive function. Executive function is exactly what you're short on when paralysis hits.

So eliminate decisions entirely:
- What do I work on? *(Already decided, one task visible)*
- Which tool do I use? *(Only one tool exists)*
- How long should I work? *(Timer is pre-set)*
- When do I take a break? *(Timer tells you)*

When you sit down to work, the only action is: start. One click. Done.

### Principle 3: No Login, No Setup, No Barriers

Every login is a friction point.
Every setup step is a friction point.
Every "let me just configure this first" is a friction point.

The best system has no barriers whatsoever. You arrive, you start. Nothing else.

### Principle 4: One Task, Visible, Ready

Not a list of tasks. Not a prioritized backlog. Not a "pick what feels right."

**One task.** Already chosen. Already visible. Already waiting for you.

The ADHD brain gets overwhelmed by choice. Remove the choice.

### Principle 5: Make It Dumber, Not Smarter

Complex systems require executive function to operate. But executive function is your weak point.

You want a system so dumb that even the most depleted, paralyzed, overwhelmed version of you can use it.

Can you start working when you're at your absolute worst? When you slept badly, when you're stressed, when your medication hasn't kicked in yet?

If not, your system is too complicated.

## The Anti-Paralysis Tool

I'll be direct with you.

After years of ADHD paralysis, after trying every productivity system, after building Notion databases with 40+ properties and abandoning them all - I built something different.

[GettingShitDone.pro](https://gettingshitdone.pro) is the anti-paralysis tool.

Here's what makes it different:

**No login.** You click, you're in. No account creation. No password. No friction before you've even started.

**No setup.** There's nothing to configure. Nothing to organize. Nothing to "set up properly before you can really use it."

**No decisions.** One task visible at a time. Timer ready to go. Focus music built in. Just... start.

**One click to working.** The gap between "I should work" and "I'm working" is literally one click. Three seconds maximum.

The philosophy is simple: **make starting work so effortless that your brain doesn't have time to bail.**

When your Wall of Awful rises up, you're already past it. When your executive function tries to find exit routes, you're already working. When paralysis tries to freeze you, the timer is already running.

You can't freeze if you're already moving.

## The 30-Second Protocol for ADHD Paralysis

When you feel paralysis setting in, here's the exact sequence:

1. **Acknowledge it** (2 seconds): "This is ADHD paralysis. My brain is looking for friction."

2. **Eliminate decisions** (5 seconds): Pick ONE task. Not the best task. Not the most important task. Just one task you could start right now.

3. **Remove all friction** (10 seconds): Close everything except what you need. If you can use a zero-friction tool, open it now.

4. **Start before thinking** (3 seconds): Click. Timer on. Working.

5. **Stay in motion** (ongoing): Once you're moving, momentum takes over. The first 30 seconds is everything.

The entire sequence should take 30 seconds or less. Any longer and you're giving your brain ammunition.

## Why This Actually Works

ADHD paralysis happens at the point of initiation. It's a startup problem, not a running problem.

Once you're actually working, you can often hyperfocus for hours. The problem is the starting. Always the starting.

Zero-friction systems work because they **bypass the initiation problem entirely**. There's no moment for paralysis to grip because there's no gap between decision and action.

You're not climbing over the Wall of Awful. You're walking around it.

You're not pushing through friction. You're eliminating it.

You're not fighting your brain. You're designing for how it actually works.

## Stop Optimizing. Start Eliminating.

The productivity industry wants to sell you optimization. More features. Better systems. Complex workflows.

But for ADHD brains, **less is everything.**

Every feature is friction.
Every option is a decision.
Every system is overhead.

The goal isn't a smarter productivity system. It's a dumber one. One that requires so little from you that paralysis has nothing to grip onto.

Your brain isn't broken. It just needs the path cleared.

Clear the path. Remove the friction. And watch what happens when starting becomes effortless.

---

The Wall of Awful will always exist. Past failures don't disappear. But you can make the wall irrelevant by removing everything between you and the first step.

**[Start now. One click. Zero friction.](https://gettingshitdone.pro)**

Your brain is waiting to prove what it can do - once you stop making it climb walls to get there.
