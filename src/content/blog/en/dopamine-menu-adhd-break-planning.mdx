faq:
  - question: "What is a dopamine menu for ADHD?"
    answer: "A dopamine menu is a pre-planned list of activities organized by effort level and dopamine reward. Instead of defaulting to scrolling during breaks, you choose from your personalized 'menu' of activities that actually recharge you. Categories typically include quick snacks (5 min), appetizers (10-15 min), main courses (30+ min), and special treats for accomplishments."
  - question: "Why do ADHD brains need a dopamine menu?"
    answer: "ADHD brains have lower baseline dopamine and struggle with impulse control during transitions. Without a plan, breaks default to the easiest dopamine source: your phone. A dopamine menu removes the decision-making (which ADHD brains struggle with) and provides pre-approved options that actually restore your energy instead of depleting it."
  - question: "What should I put on my dopamine menu?"
    answer: "Include activities across different effort levels: Quick (stretch, make tea, step outside), Medium (play one song on an instrument, sketch, short walk), Longer (video game with timer, hobby project, call a friend). The key is choosing activities YOU genuinely enjoy that have a natural endpoint, unlike infinite scroll apps."
  - question: "How do I stop scrolling and use my dopamine menu instead?"
    answer: "Remove the decision moment. When your work timer ends, your break activity should already be decided. Some people write their dopamine menu on a physical card by their desk. Others use a random picker. The key is making 'check the menu' easier than 'grab the phone.' Environment design beats willpower."

You finished a focus session. Time for a break.

"I'll just check my phone for five minutes."

Forty-five minutes later, you're still scrolling. The break that was supposed to recharge you has left you more drained than when you started. You feel foggy, guilty, and somehow even less motivated to get back to work.

Sound familiar?

**This isn't a willpower problem. It's a planning problem.** And there's a simple ADHD strategy that fixes it.

## The Break Problem Nobody Talks About

Most productivity advice focuses on how to work. How to focus. How to be more efficient.

Almost nobody talks about how to rest.

And for ADHD brains, this is a critical oversight. Because how you spend your breaks determines whether you can actually get back to work afterward.

Here's what happens when you don't plan your breaks:

1. Your work session ends
2. Your brain immediately craves dopamine (it just spent energy focusing)
3. You reach for the easiest dopamine source: your phone
4. Infinite scroll apps are designed to never satisfy you
5. You keep scrolling because you never feel "done"
6. Twenty, thirty, forty minutes pass
7. You finally stop, but you're more depleted than before
8. Getting back to work feels impossible
9. You either force yourself (exhausting) or give up (demoralizing)

**The phone isn't the problem. The lack of a plan is the problem.**

Your brain needed dopamine during that break. That's legitimate. ADHD brains have lower baseline dopamine and need regular "refills" to function.

But scrolling is junk food dopamine. It triggers the reward system without actually satisfying it. You keep consuming because you never feel full.

What if you had a menu of break activities that actually recharged you?

## Enter the Dopamine Menu

The dopamine menu is a concept that's been floating around ADHD communities for a few years. The idea is simple but powerful:

**Create a pre-planned "menu" of activities organized by effort level and time required. When it's break time, you pick from your menu instead of defaulting to your phone.**

Why does this work?

### 1. It Removes Decision-Making

ADHD brains struggle with decisions, especially during transitions. When your work session ends, your executive function is depleted. Asking your brain "what should I do for my break?" at that moment is asking it to make a decision when it's least capable of making good ones.

The dopamine menu eliminates that decision. The options are pre-selected. You just pick one.

### 2. It Provides Legitimate Dopamine

Not all dopamine is created equal. Scrolling provides "empty" dopamine: quick hits that don't satisfy. Your menu items are activities you genuinely enjoy and that leave you feeling better afterward.

The difference is like snacking on candy versus eating a real meal. Both provide energy. Only one leaves you satisfied.

### 3. It Has Natural Endpoints

Infinite scroll is infinite. There's no natural stopping point. Your brain never gets the "I'm done" signal.

Good menu items have built-in endings. You finish a chapter. You complete a sketch. The song ends. The walk ends. Your brain gets closure, which makes returning to work much easier.

### 4. It's Personalized to You

Generic advice like "take a walk" or "do some stretching" doesn't account for what actually brings you joy. Your dopamine menu is yours. It includes the specific activities that YOUR brain finds rewarding.

Maybe that's playing three minutes of a video game. Maybe it's watching one YouTube video (with a timer). Maybe it's lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. If it recharges you, it belongs on your menu.

## How to Build Your Dopamine Menu

Here's a framework for creating your own menu. The key is organizing activities by time and effort, so you can match your break activity to your actual break length.

### Category 1: Snacks (2-5 minutes)

These are quick hits for short breaks. Minimal effort, quick payoff.

**Examples:**
- Step outside and feel the sun/air for 60 seconds
- Stretch (pick 2-3 specific stretches you like)
- Make tea or coffee (the ritual, not the caffeine)
- Pet your dog/cat
- Look out the window
- Eat a small snack mindfully
- Do 10 jumping jacks
- Smell something nice (candle, essential oil, fresh air)
- Text one friend something positive
- Drink a full glass of water

**The key:** These should require almost zero activation energy. You can do them even when your brain is fried.

### Category 2: Appetizers (10-15 minutes)

For longer breaks. More satisfying but still bounded.

**Examples:**
- Listen to 2-3 favorite songs (not on shuffle, pick them intentionally)
- Play one round of a mobile game (not infinite scrollers)
- Do a quick sketch or doodle
- Read one article you saved (not browsing for articles)
- Watch ONE short video (pre-selected, not algorithmic)
- Quick tidy of one surface (desk, coffee table)
- Play an instrument for a few minutes
- Step outside for a short walk around the block
- Do a 10-minute guided meditation
- Journal one page

**The key:** Natural endpoints. One round. One article. One song. Not "scrolling until I feel done" because that never happens.

### Category 3: Main Courses (30+ minutes)

For longer breaks or rewards after big accomplishments.

**Examples:**
- Play a video game with a timer set
- Watch one episode of a show (not "one more episode")
- Work on a hobby project (art, music, coding for fun)
- Go for a real walk (20-30 minutes)
- Call or video chat a friend
- Take a proper nap (set an alarm)
- Read a physical book
- Cook or bake something
- Exercise or workout
- Play with a pet actively

**The key:** These require more commitment but provide deeper restoration. They're for when you've genuinely earned a longer break.

### Category 4: Specials (Context-Dependent)

Activities that only work in certain situations but are especially rewarding.

**Examples:**
- Sit in a coffee shop and people-watch
- Visit a bookstore or library
- Take a bath or long shower
- Go to a park
- Work on a side project that excites you
- Try a new restaurant alone
- Go to a movie by yourself

**The key:** These are treats. Not everyday options, but things to look forward to after particularly hard work.

## The Critical Rule: No Infinite Scrollers

You might have noticed what's NOT on any of these lists:

- Browsing social media
- Scrolling TikTok/Instagram/Twitter
- Browsing Reddit without a specific goal
- Watching "just one more" YouTube recommendations
- Checking email or messages repeatedly

These activities aren't inherently evil. But they're designed to never satisfy you. They're optimized for engagement, not for your restoration.

**If an activity has no natural endpoint, it doesn't belong on your dopamine menu.**

"But I enjoy scrolling!"

You enjoy the first few minutes. After that, you're in a dopamine trap, continuing not because it feels good but because stopping feels hard.

The test: How do you feel AFTER the activity? If you feel restored, it belongs on your menu. If you feel foggy, guilty, and less motivated than before, it doesn't.

## How to Actually Use Your Menu

Creating the menu is step one. Actually using it is step two. Here's how to make it stick:

### 1. Write It Down Physically

A dopamine menu in your head is useless. When your break starts and your executive function is depleted, you won't remember what's on it.

Write it on a card. Stick it next to your monitor. Put it where you'll see it the moment your work timer ends.

### 2. Decide BEFORE the Break Ends

When your work session is wrapping up, glance at your menu and pick your break activity before the timer goes off. Don't wait until you're in "break mode" to decide.

This is like choosing what you'll eat before you're hungry. Hungry-you makes bad decisions. Depleted-break-you makes bad decisions. Decide in advance.

### 3. Use a Timer for Your Break

This is crucial. Your break has a time limit. Set a timer for it.

Not a vague "I'll take a 10-minute break." An actual timer counting down. When it ends, your break ends. No negotiation.

This is especially important for "main course" activities like video games. Without a timer, a 30-minute gaming break becomes a 3-hour gaming session. The timer creates the boundary your brain can't create internally.

### 4. Make Your Menu Easier Than Your Phone

Environment design beats willpower every time.

If your phone is right next to you and your dopamine menu is in a drawer somewhere, you'll grab the phone. Make the menu more visible and accessible than the phone.

Some people put their phone in another room during work sessions. When the break comes, the menu is right there. The phone requires walking to get. That small friction is often enough.

## When Breaks Go Wrong (And How to Recover)

Even with a dopamine menu, you'll sometimes fall into the scroll trap. It happens. Here's how to handle it:

**Don't shame yourself.** Shame makes ADHD worse, not better. Your brain sought easy dopamine. That's what ADHD brains do. Notice it and move on.

**Set a "rescue timer."** If you catch yourself scrolling, immediately set a timer for 2 minutes. When it goes off, you stop. This limits the damage without requiring you to stop "cold turkey" (which feels impossible once you're in the scroll zone).

**Do a "pattern interrupt."** Stand up. Go to a different room. Splash water on your face. Physically change something to break the scroll trance. Then return to your menu.

**Update your menu.** If you keep avoiding your menu items, they might not actually be appealing to you. Swap them out. The menu should contain things you WANT to do, not things you think you "should" do.

## The Tool That Ties It Together

Here's the thing about dopamine menus: they work best when paired with timed work sessions.

The Pomodoro technique (work for 25 minutes, break for 5) creates natural break points. When the timer ends, you know exactly when to consult your menu. The structure is external, which is what ADHD brains need.

I built [Getting Shit Done](https://gettingshitdone.pro) with this in mind:

- **Visible timer** that counts down your work session AND your break
- **Clear break signal** so you know exactly when to consult your menu
- **No setup friction** so you can't procrastinate starting your next work session
- **Focus audio** that creates a clear distinction between work mode and break mode

The timer isn't just for work. It's for breaks too. Set your break timer, do your menu activity, and when the timer ends, you're back to work. External structure for both sides of the cycle.

## Your Dopamine Menu Starter Template

Here's a template to get you started. Personalize it ruthlessly. Delete anything that doesn't genuinely appeal to you. Add your own weird, specific pleasures.

```
MY DOPAMINE MENU

SNACKS (2-5 min)
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________

APPETIZERS (10-15 min)
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________

MAIN COURSES (30+ min)
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________

SPECIALS (treats)
- [ ] _______________
- [ ] _______________
```

Print it. Put it by your desk. Use it.

## The Bottom Line

Your ADHD brain needs dopamine during breaks. That's not negotiable. The question is where that dopamine comes from.

**Scrolling** provides junk dopamine that leaves you worse than before.

**Your dopamine menu** provides real satisfaction that actually restores your energy.

The difference:
- Pre-planned vs. defaulting to the easiest option
- Natural endpoints vs. infinite engagement
- Genuine enjoyment vs. empty consumption
- Feeling restored vs. feeling foggy

Build your menu. Write it down. Put it where you'll see it. And when your work timer ends, pick something from your menu instead of reaching for your phone.

Your breaks should recharge you, not drain you. **Plan your dopamine like you plan your work.**
