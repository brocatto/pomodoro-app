faq:
  - question: "What is time blindness in ADHD?"
    answer: "Time blindness is the difficulty perceiving the passage of time accurately. For ADHD brains, time doesn't feel like a continuous flow. It's either 'now' or 'not now.' This is why five minutes can feel like an hour (during boring tasks) or an hour can feel like five minutes (during interesting ones). It's a neurological difference, not a character flaw."
  - question: "Why do people with ADHD work better under pressure?"
    answer: "Deadlines and pressure trigger noradrenaline release, which temporarily boosts executive function and focus. ADHD brains are chronically understimulated, so the 'threat' of a deadline provides the stimulation needed to activate focus. This isn't a character flaw. It's your brain seeking the activation it needs to function."
  - question: "Is it bad to rely on deadline pressure for motivation?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. The problem isn't using pressure. It's relying on external deadlines you can't control. The solution is creating artificial urgency you control, using short timers and visible countdowns. This gives you the benefits of pressure without the stress of real consequences."
  - question: "What's the difference between time batching and task batching?"
    answer: "Task batching groups similar tasks together (all emails, then all calls). Time batching allocates specific time blocks to work, regardless of completion. For ADHD brains, time batching works better because it creates external structure and deadlines. You're not working until the task is done. You're working until the timer ends."

Let me guess something about you.

You've pulled off incredible work in the final hours before a deadline. Work that should have taken days, done in one caffeinated night.

But that same project? When you had two weeks to do it? Nothing. Paralysis. You couldn't even start.

People call this procrastination. They call it laziness. They say you need better time management.

They're wrong.

**You have time blindness.** And once you understand it, you can turn it from your biggest weakness into your greatest advantage.

## Time Blindness: The ADHD Experience of Time

For neurotypical brains, time flows like a river. They can feel fifteen minutes passing. They have an intuitive sense of "I have an hour before the meeting."

For ADHD brains, **time doesn't exist the same way.**

Time isn't a river. It's two buckets: **NOW** and **NOT NOW**.

That deadline in two weeks? Not now. The project due tomorrow? Not now. The meeting in one hour? Not now.

Then suddenly, it's now. And you have twenty minutes to do what should take three hours.

This isn't poor planning. It's a fundamentally different perception of time.

Dr. Russell Barkley, one of the leading ADHD researchers, calls this "temporal myopia", the inability to look into the future and feel it as real.

**The future doesn't feel real until it becomes the present.**

## Why "Just Use a Calendar" Doesn't Work

Standard time management advice assumes you can feel time passing:

- "Break the project into smaller deadlines"
- "Work backwards from the due date"
- "Schedule time blocks for each part"

This works for neurotypical brains because they experience the intermediate deadlines as real.

For ADHD brains, **putting something on a calendar doesn't make it feel real.** It just creates another "not now" entry that you'll ignore until it becomes "now."

You've probably tried this. You blocked time for the project. When the time came, you felt nothing. No urgency. No activation. The calendar said "work on project" and your brain said "but that's not really due yet."

**External deadlines on paper don't create internal urgency.**

## The Hidden Superpower: Urgency Creates Focus

Here's what most people miss about ADHD and deadlines.

When something becomes urgent, your brain floods with noradrenaline (norepinephrine). This neurotransmitter:
- Sharpens focus
- Increases alertness
- Boosts working memory
- Activates the prefrontal cortex

Essentially, urgency temporarily "fixes" the executive function deficits of ADHD.

**This is why you do your best work under pressure.** Your brain finally has the chemical conditions it needs to focus.

The problem isn't that you need deadlines. The problem is that you're waiting for external deadlines to create the urgency, and by then, the pressure is stressful rather than productive.

**What if you could create urgency on demand?**

## Time Batching vs. Task Batching: What Actually Works

Most productivity systems use task batching: group similar tasks and do them all at once. All emails, then all calls, then all writing.

This assumes you can maintain focus across a flexible time period. For ADHD brains, this doesn't work. Without a time constraint, tasks expand infinitely or never start at all.

**Time batching works differently:**

Instead of "I'll do all my emails," it's "I'll work on emails for exactly 25 minutes."

The shift is subtle but powerful:
- You're not working until done. You're working until the timer ends.
- The timer creates artificial urgency.
- The end point is external and certain.
- Your brain activates because there's a real constraint.

**You're racing against the clock, not against a vague sense of "should be done by now."**

## The Protocol: Manufacturing Urgency

Here's how to use time blindness as a superpower instead of fighting against it:

### Step 1: Accept the NOW/NOT NOW Reality

Stop pretending you'll feel urgency for something due next week. You won't. Your brain doesn't work that way, and that's okay.

Instead, design your system around NOW. Create urgency in the present moment.

### Step 2: Make Time Visible

Time blindness means you can't feel time. So make it something you can see.

- Visible countdown timers
- Progress bars
- Timers that stay in your face, not hidden in a tab

When time is visible, your brain can track it. When it's invisible, it doesn't exist.

### Step 3: Race the Clock

Give yourself less time than you think you need. Not cruelly less, but enough to create urgency.

Think you need two hours? Try 50 minutes.

The slight pressure activates your brain. The visibility keeps you aware. And you'll often find you work faster under artificial urgency than unlimited time.

### Step 4: Use Sprints, Not Marathons

ADHD brains don't do well with long, unstructured work periods. Four hours of "working on the project" is four hours of fighting your brain.

But four 50-minute sprints with breaks? Each one is a fresh NOW with its own urgency.

The Pomodoro technique works for ADHD specifically because it converts vague future work into present-moment races.

## Why This Works: The Neuroscience

When you're racing a visible timer:

1. **Noradrenaline releases** because there's time pressure
2. **Dopamine anticipates** the reward of beating the clock
3. **The prefrontal cortex activates** to manage the challenge
4. **Distraction resistance increases** because there's urgency

You're essentially hacking your brain into providing the neurochemicals it usually withholds.

This isn't "tricking yourself into working." This is giving your ADHD brain the environmental conditions it needs to function optimally.

**You're not broken. You just need different activation conditions.**

## Stop Fighting Your Brain. Use It.

The conventional approach to ADHD and time is to fight the time blindness. Use calendars harder. Set more reminders. Force yourself to feel future deadlines.

This is exhausting and rarely works.

The alternative is to **work with your brain's design:**

- You work well under pressure? Create pressure.
- You can't feel future time? Make present time visible.
- You work in bursts? Design for bursts.
- You need urgency? Manufacture urgency.

**Time blindness isn't a bug. It's a different operating system.** And once you stop trying to run neurotypical software on it, things start working.

## The Tool That Makes This Automatic

I'm not going to pretend you need a special tool for this. A kitchen timer works. A phone timer works.

But here's why I built [Getting Shit Done](https://gettingshitdone.pro) specifically for this:

- **Visible timer** that stays in your face (not hidden in another tab)
- **Focus sessions** that create artificial urgency automatically
- **Short sprints** designed for ADHD work patterns
- **No setup friction** so you can start a race against the clock immediately

The philosophy is simple: make time visible, create urgency, race the clock.

If you've spent your life being told you're lazy, undisciplined, or bad at time management, try this instead: **your brain works differently, not worse.** Give it the conditions it needs, and watch what happens.

You're not broken. You're running on pressure. So let's give you pressure you can control.
